# Rhino-ScriptRunner
The Rhino-ScriptRunner is a demonstration app that shows how to embed the Rhino JavaScript engine into a Java servlet. 

The user enters JavaScript code into the script field and clicks the run button. The Java servlet runs the script in the Rhino JavaScript engine context and sends the script result back to the client.
